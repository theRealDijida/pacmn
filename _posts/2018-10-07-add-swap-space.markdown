<h1>
Add Swap Space! 
</h1>

Recently, the $Pac network came under attack. You can find details here on the official $Pac site [https://blog.paccoin.net/pac-network-robust-malicious-transaction-attackers/](https://blog.paccoin.net/pac-network-robust-malicious-transaction-attackers/){:target="_blank"}. 

What you **_MUST_** do to keep your MN up and running is to add swap space in order to keep your MN process resilient to these types of attacks. These instructions are from foxD and is a simple one line copy/paste in your vps. You can find the link and instructions here: [Add Swap Space]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/install-server/#add-swap-space).
