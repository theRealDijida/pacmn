Next we'll edit a special file on your desktop wallet named `masternode.conf` and "Start" your MN on the $Pac network. 
A quick reminder of where we are below:

<b>Steps to create your Master Node</b>

- [x] &nbsp; ~~1. Getting Ready~~
- [x] &nbsp; ~~2. Configure your desktop wallet~~
- [x] &nbsp; ~~. Install Masternode server on your VPS~~
- [ ] &nbsp; <mark>4. Start your Masternode</mark>
- [ ] &nbsp; 5. Monitor your Masternode and collect rewards


# Edit Masternode Configuration

On your cold (desktop) wallet installation, there is a special file called "masternode.conf" which contains information needed to properly remote start and broadcast your new MN to the $Pac network. To access this file, from the main toolbar on your wallet, go to Tools -> Open Masternode Configuration File:

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/tools-mnconfig.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;"/>

This will open the file `masternode.conf` in your text editor. The first 2 lines of the file are commented out using the `#` character and show the format needed. We'll need to enter the following 4 pieces of information that you should already have in your text editor:

(1). alias - this is the unique name for your Masternode. If you followed the recommended naming convention (MN1, MN2, etc), this is the same name found in **step 9** of [Install Server: Set Hostname and Deploy]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/install-server/#set-hostname-and-deploy).
<br/>

(2). IP:port - this is the IP Address of your Masternode VPS that you copied from **step 11** of [Install Server: Set Hostname and Deploy]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/install-server/#set-hostname-and-deploy). Your IP Address in this file needs to be appended with `:7112`. For example: 175.145.10.150:7112
<br/>

(3). Masternode Private Key - this is the private key we generated in **step 4** of [Configure Desktop: Generate Private Key]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/configure-desktop/#generate-private-key).
<br/>

(4). Collateral Output and Index - this is the collateral id and index of the 500K $Pac we sent to collateralize our Masternode, from **step 5** of [Configure Desktop: Get Collateral Tx Id]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/configure-desktop/#get-collateral-tx-id).

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/mnconf.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;"/>

Referring to the screen shot above, add your Masternode information on the 3rd line. Make sure that you have exactly one space between sections 1, 2, 3, and 4. Also, verify that you have `:7112` on the end of your IP Address, and that there is a space at the end between your collateral tx id and index (the index will be either a `0` or a `1`).

<br/>

Once you've double checked the entries, save the file, and close out of your editor. 

Go back to the $Pac Desktop Wallet, and close the program. Restart your $Pac Desktop Wallet so that it can read the configuration information for your newly configured remote MN. 


In the next step, we will start and broadcast our Masternode onto the network.


# Start Your Masternode

Once you restart your desktop wallet, go to the "Masternodes" tab. From there you should see your newly configured Masternode displayed in the table as shown below:

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/mn-tab2.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;"/>


(1). This is the alias you configured previously ("MyMN1" in the screen shot).
<br/>

(2). This is your remote MN's vps IP Address with `:7112` appended at the end.
<br/>

(3). This is your **Unique** $Pac receiving address where your Masternode Rewards will be paid to, as we configured in [Configure Desktop: Create Unique MN Wallet Address]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/configure-desktop/#create-unique-mn-wallet-address).
<br/>


<br/>
These next steps will "start" your Masternode on the $Pac network as well as broadcast to the network your MN's IP Address and collateral tx id (needed for validation).


- 1\. Select your Masternode in the Masternode's table.
- 2\. Click the "Start Alias" button:

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/mn-tab3.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;"/>

- 3\. Select "Yes" and enter your wallet passphrase when prompted , then hit ok.


<br/>

Now that the Masternode is started, let's check to see that it started sucessfully on the remote VPS.



<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p>
    <strong>DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE "STATUS" FIELD ON YOUR DESKTOP WALLET!</strong>
    The status field is incorrect much of the time. It is a known bug that will be addressed in future updates (inherited from the Dash wallet), so don't worry about what is displayed there.
    </p>
</div>



# Verify Your Masternode Status

The follwing commands to help verify your overall setup, these are also a few key commands when verifying problems on a server.
Use the **up arrow** to re run the commands and you are monitoring status changes. They remain in log as long as the server is up and can be quickly accessed even after you relog in. If locked into the wrong command use **Cntrl + C** to exit certain commands.

### 1- Check Masternode Status

Go back to your ssh client and copy/paste the following into your terminal:

<div class="example" >Check MN Status
</div>

```bash
./paccoin-cli masternode status
```
You should see something similar to the screen shot below. Make sure that the status says "Masternode successfully started":

<br/>
<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/mn-status.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;"/>


### 2- Synchronization (Asset ID = 999)
If Status is something other then above re-check sync status by executing the following command and see if "AssetId" field shows `999` as shown in the screen shot. This can take 10 - 15 minutes. 

<div class="example" >$Pac SystemD Service (click copy icon)
</div>

```bash
./paccoin-cli mnsync status
```

Otherwise press enter to continue. You should see something similar to the screen shot below when your MN is fully synched:

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/ssh8.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 75%;"/>


### 3- Check Service Status (If installed)

If you had installed the `systemd` service as explained in the section [Install $Pac MN Service]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/install-server/#install-pac-mn-service) copy/paste (or type) the following:

<div class="example" >$Pac SystemD Service (click copy icon)
</div>

```bash
systemctl status pacd --no-pager
```

Check to make sure status is green and their are no errors. This service will help prevent downtime due to failures in the future so it is important is running properly after the satus of the rest of your system is running.

### 4- Check Free Memory

As stated before, it is not a good idea to max the memory. If future updates or something causing the memory to spike it may cause your instance to crash.
Use this command to check memory status now that everything is installed to confirm you have at plenty of free memory available.

<div class="example" >Checking memory (click copy icon)
</div>

```bash
free -m
```

Note that Linux memory is different and the buff/cache is the available memory.

# Next Step: Monitor Your Masternode

Your Masternode is now up and running! The next step is to [Monitor Your Masternode]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/monitor-mn) and collect rewards.
